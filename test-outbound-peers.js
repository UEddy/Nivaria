// competitor monitoring (core product, a feature of a different core business,
// or an adjacent monitoring product) is a peer and must never become a lead. A
// company that does competitor tracking manually, hires for it, or loses deals
// to rivals is a prospect. Pure, no DB/network — run with
// `node test-outbound-peers.js`.
